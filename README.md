# deep-learning-Japanese

This programm is an artificial neural Network meant to classify Japanese Kanji entirely written with just numpy

In addition to the python programm, there is a processing programm, which serves as a GUI.

By running both the python and the processing programm at the same time, you can then use the GUI to draw a Kanji and have it determined by the neural network by simply pressing the "send" Button. This programm will also provide you with multiple readings as well as translations of the Japanese Kanji.

!!make sure to have all the files in this repository in the same Folder or the programm wont run!!

!!using the ".exe" files will probably not work, since they are outdated!!
